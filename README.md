# Communication_Systems
This project focuses on communication systems and consists of two main parts: Part 1 and Part 2.

Part 1: Transmitter and Receiver Transmitter (TX) The transmitter generates a random stream of 10,000 bits (0s and 1s) using different line coding types. It performs the following tasks:

Generates a random stream of bits. Utilizes various line coding types. Plots the eye diagram for the transmitted signal. Generates the power spectral density (PSD) plot for the transmitted signal. Receiver (RX) The receiver receives the transmitted signal and performs the following tasks:

Compares the received bits with the original stream of bits. Calculates the number of errors. Computes the bit error rate (BER) based on the received and original bits.

Part 2: Transmitter and Receiver Transmitter (TX) The transmitter generates a stream of bits using the Polar Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) line coding. It accomplishes the following:

Generates a stream of bits using Polar NRZ line coding. Performs BPSK modulation. Plots the spectral domain of the modulated BPSK signal. Provides the time-domain representation of the modulated signal. Receiver (RX) The receiver receives the modulated BPSK signal and conducts the following tasks:

Compares the received bits with the original stream of bits. Determines the number of errors in the received bits. Evaluates the bit error rate (BER) by comparing received and original bits.
